            <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> You'll compete against players with similar skill levels.</li>

          </h3>
          <p className="js-scroll-trigger">
            We'll use the warmup time before each scrimmage to check key skills like hitting, fielding, throwing 
            (including pitching), and running speed. These check-ins will follow iPride guidelines but will be short and low-stress.

          </h3>
          <p className="js-scroll-trigger">
            Each team should attend at least one scrimmage. If someone can't make it, we'll offer a couple of makeup dates.

              <li>Within these throwing questions (21-26), evaluators will also assess the following pitching criteria:
                <ul>
                  <li>Deliver multiple pitch techniques (e.g., curve, change up) while pitching a strike and/or causing the batter to swing (60% threshold).</li>
                  <li>Vary the height, depth, and location of the pitch while pitching a strike and/or causing the batter to swing (60% threshold).</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>A "strike" is a legally delivered ball that enters the strike zone or that the batter swings at and misses.</li>
                  <li>"Multiple pitch techniques" refers to the ability to use arc, spin, location and movement of the ball to deliver 
                      various pitches (e.g. curve, change up, cutter / reverse curve, knuckle ball) that are called strikes or cause the batter to swing.</li>
                  <li>"Vary the height, depth, and location" means the pitcher can control where the ball goes within and around the strike zone.</li>
