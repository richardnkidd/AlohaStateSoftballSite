The **Anuenue Classic** is ASSL’s annual invitational tournament in Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi.

- **Cadence:** Held **every year** on the **last weekend in March**.  
- **Divisions:** C, D, E (final brackets announced closer to the event).  
- **Rules snapshot:** USA Softball rules with ASSL/iPride adaptations. See *Gameplay Rules* for HR limits, time limits, and tiebreaker.  
- **Registration:** Posted on our Linktree and socials when live.

> Note: Add the exact dates, entry fee, and captain’s meeting details when the tournament announcement is published.

After updating files
	•	Run your build so league-content.js regenerates:
	◦	npm run build:content
	•	Keep your retrieval synonyms including "instagram", "ig", "insta" so the bot reliably finds the Instagram link in links.md.
	•	Ensure your retriever fallback (rules-faq, rules, tournament, about, links, ratings, board) remains enabled so vague questions still get context.
