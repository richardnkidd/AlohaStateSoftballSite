Replit Task — Update ASSL Markdown for Signup, Season, and Tournament Answers (Nano-Safe)

Objectives
	1.	Add/refresh MD files so the bot can answer:
	•	How do I sign up? (clear steps + links)
	•	When is the next season? → Every Summer (Season 4: Summer 2025)
	•	When is the next tournament? → Annual, last weekend in March + exact dates (set below)
	2.	Keep content short, tagged with real synonyms (sign up, register, join, next season, next tournament), and no Division B.
	3.	After updating, rebuild your content bundle so the Lambda sees the changes.

4) (Optional but recommended) Update summaries so the bot repeats timing clearly

Append to /content/about.md (if not already present):

**Season cadence:** We play **every Summer** in Honolulu (Ala Wai Community Park).  
**Tournament cadence:** Our annual tournament is the **last weekend in March**. See *Tournament* for exact dates.

Ensure /content/links.md includes:

- **LinkTree (All Links):** https://linktr.ee/alohastatesoftball
- **TeamSideline (Scores/Standings/Schedule):** https://teamsideline.com/sites/aikaneohana/schedules
- **Instagram:** https://www.instagram.com/alohastatesoftballleague


⸻

Retrieval Synonyms (make answers easy to find)

Make sure these appear in the tags or the text of the updated MD:
	•	signup synonyms: sign up, signup, register, registration, join, get started, free agent
	•	season synonyms: next season, season, schedule, summer, calendar, when do we play
	•	tournament synonyms: next tournament, anuenue classic, dates, march, registration

⸻

Build step

After editing the files, run your content build so the function sees the new sections:

npm run build:content
# then your normal build/deploy steps

Tip: Ensure your retriever’s intent routing forces in:
	•	“sign up / register / join / free agent” → joining
	•	“next season / season / summer / schedule” → season (and links)
	•	“tournament / anuenue / dates / march / next tournament” → tournament (and links)
