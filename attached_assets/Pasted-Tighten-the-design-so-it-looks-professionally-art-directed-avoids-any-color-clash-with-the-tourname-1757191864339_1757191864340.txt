Tighten the design so it looks professionally art-directed, avoids any color clash with the tournament logo, and updates the title.

Required changes

Title copy & style

Replace H1 with exactly: ĀNUENUE CLASSIC 2026 (all caps).

Slightly wider tracking on desktop (letter-spacing: .02em) and strong optical size (48–64px desktop / 32–40px mobile).

Keep the subtle spotlight behind the H1 but reduce opacity to 20–28% so it doesn’t haze the logo.

Logo-safe color system (no clash)

Base the banner on calm sand/sky tints that complement a navy + yellow softball logo; avoid hot pink/orange near the logo area.

Implement this palette and gradient (mobile-first):

:root{
  /* sampled to avoid clash with navy/yellow logo */
  --sand-50:#F9F5EC;
  --sky-50:#EEF7FB;
  --aqua-50:#EAF6F3;
  --ink:#0F172A;
  --muted:#6B7280;

  /* accent used sparingly for CTA only */
  --cta-start:#FF8A66; /* coral */
  --cta-end:#FFC168;   /* mango */
}
.hero{
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--sand-50) 0%, var(--sky-50) 55%, var(--aqua-50) 100%);
}


Add a 1px rainbow border on the hero wrapper only (very faint, 30% opacity) to nod to Pride without competing with the badge.

Ensure all cards use white with a soft inner gradient and realistic layered shadows; keep contrast AA+.

CTA refinement (no AI “glow”)

Keep the pill button, but remove outer glows. Use the coral→mango gradient above, with tactile hover/active states and the existing confetti micro-burst (respect prefers-reduced-motion).

Copy to keep (unchanged)

Subhead, the three info chips, “Official Aloha State Softball League Tournament,” the supporting line, and the inclusivity note—replace emoji with inline SVGs.

Nice-to-have polish

Slight parallax drift on the background (1–2°), disabled for reduced-motion.

Add a logo-safe CSS class that can switch the banner to a single-color fallback if needed:

.hero.logo-safe{ background:#FAF7F0; }


Acceptance criteria

H1 shows ĀNUENUE CLASSIC 2026 in all caps.

Banner colors read as neutral sand/sky/aqua and do not visually fight the navy/yellow logo.

No neon or plastic AI sheen; shadows and textures feel real; WCAG AA contrast met.

Mobile looks clean at 320px with readable type and tappable targets.
