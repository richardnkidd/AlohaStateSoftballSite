Goal: fairness and safety by grouping similar skill levels. ASSL currently fields **C, D, E** only.

## Method
- **Sunday Scrimmages** (Crane Field, April–May) inform ratings.
- **26‑question rubric** across **Hitting (1–9)**, **Running Speed (10–12)**, **Fielding (13–20)**, **Throwing (21–26)**.
- **60% rule:** a question is “YES” at ≥60% success.

## Placement (YES counts)
- **E:** 0–6 YES — newer players, developing skills.  
- **D:** 5–12 YES — intermediate recreational.  
- **C:** 10–18 YES — experienced recreational.

> The league does **not** place players into a B Division.

## Restrictions
- **E:** may **not** hit high‑velocity balls ≥20% nor hit fly balls **>300 ft**.  
- **D:** may **not** hit fly balls **>300 ft**.

## Velocity tiers
- **Low:** ≤150 ft • **Medium:** 150–250 ft • **High:** >250 ft

## MBA (Modified Batting Average)
- Tracks consistent hitting ability at appropriate levels.
